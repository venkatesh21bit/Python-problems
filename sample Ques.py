#You've uncovered a mysterious text file named "number_series.txt" that contains a sequence of ten numbers. This sequence holds a secret, and your mission is to create a Python program that reads these numbers, computes their recursive sum and average using two separate recursive functions, and reveals the hidden patterns within.

#Here's the step-by-step guide for your program:

#Create a text file named "number_series.txt" with the following content:
#12 8 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40

#1. Write a Python program to read the numbers from the file and store them in a list.

#2. Implement a recursive function compute_recursive_sum that takes a list as input and calculates the sum of its elements. Use the compute_recursive_sum function to find the recursive sum of the numbers obtained in step 2.

#3. Implement another recursive function compute_recursive_average that takes a list, the current index, and the cumulative sum as input and calculates the average of the elements. Use the compute_recursive_average function to find the recursive average of the numbers obtained in step 2.

#4. Print the original list, the recursive sum, and the recursiveÂ average.
